	<h2>Philosophical reminders</h2>
	<ul class="ul-freeform">
		<li>"If you knew how much work went into it, you wouldn't call it genius" - <i>Michelangelo</i></li>
		<li>Maintain two trains of thought because your unconscious, impulsive thoughts and ideas may not always be the best, logically.</li>
		<li>Just because people only have nice things to say about you doesn't mean they could automatically be considered friends.</li>
		<li>People don't actually want to know what <i>you</i> think. They only want to hear what they want to hear - just coming out of your mouth.</li>
		<li>People only appreciate what you can do for them, not for what you can do for yourself.</li>
		<li>Let the moment pass if you feel frustrated. Most of the time your initial emotional reaction is exaggerated and reactionary. Step aside and logically consider how you got into that situation in the first place.</li>
