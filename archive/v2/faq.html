	<h3>What do I do?</h3>
	<p>
		I'm a software engineering student at Monash University. I like to do my own projects based on what I learn at uni... sometimes things I'm learning by myself outside of uni too.
	</p>

	<h3>What got you interested in computers?</h3>
	<p>
		It all started when I walked into an Apple store in 2007. At the time my family was using one of those generic PCs with a Pentium 4 CPU, running Windows XP. That shit was slow. Scrubbing through a video clip in iMovie on an iMac was like trying frozen yogurt for the first time (i.e. why aren't <i>all</i> computers like this?).

	<h3>Why did you develop yet another Linux distribution?</h3>
	<p>
		Because it's fun (and educational)! I'm doing it to figure out how the whole shebang works - from the Linux filesystem to how packages are updated.

	<h3>Why does this site look so awful?</h3>
