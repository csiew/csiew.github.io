## What? Another blog?

**7 September 2017**

Ok yes! I'm obsessed with finding out new ways to blog without even knowing what to blog (counting out my [tech blog](https://clarencesiew.wordpress.com/)). I think I'll post short stories and some artwork here (because Instagram is just too cliché).

I've been meaning to write some stories. I've been thinking that in my head for the last 5 years. The same goes with my art. I've been caught up with numerous projects as my interest in tech reignited and as I'm now a software engineering student.

…but I still yearn to create stories, imaginary scenarios, fictional worlds.
