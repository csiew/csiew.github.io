      <h1>Rancid</h1>
      <p id="post_date_line">Saturday, 21 January 2017</p>
      <p>
        A nickname given by thyself<br />
        When he wasn't what it was
      </p>
      <p>
        A name which sat on the shelf,<br />
        As much of which I call a pause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lame as he claims to be,<br />
        For Ol' Rancid to believe...
      </p>
      <p>
        Until he asks his friends alike,<br />
        "O am I what I percieve?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Of which us comrades say,<br />
        "Rancid! What a thing to bray!"
      </p>
      <p>
        And so it came to pass,<br />
        For Rancid to reply with nothing but...
      </p>
      <p>
        O-K
      </p>
      <p>
        When the winds weathered us down,<br />
        We call for Ol' Rancid around...
      </p>
      <p>
        "Rancid! To what must I do with such pain?"<br />
        But alas, Ol' Rancid just turned his back and said...
      </p>
      <p>
        O-K.
      </p>
