## About

Hi, I'm **Clarence**. I'm a software engineering student at Monash University in Melbourne, but originating from Penang, Malaysia. I'm passionate about dreaming-up and developing software-based solutions for issues we, as society, face today. I'm also a history geek (with a particular interest in Roman and European Dark Age & Medieval history, at the moment).
