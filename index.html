		<h2>Hello</h2>

				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>I'm Clarence. Born and raised in Penang, Malaysia. I studied software engineering at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
			</dd>
			<dd>
				<h3>The things I do</h3>
				<p>Software engineering is both a passion and my intended career. I'm a full-stack developer (both back end API services and front end web applications, as well as mobile applications). You could sprinkle in some scripts (Bash and Python) if they count.</p>

				<h3>This website</h3>
				<p>The website you're looking at is hosted as a repository in both GitHub and GitLab. Both provide a service to host these repositories as websites. If you're a frequent visitor, you may find that the style and content on this page may change wildly in a very short period of time. That's because I love experimenting with CSS styling and am constantly looking at what else I could put on this website.</p>
