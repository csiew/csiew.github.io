			<h3>Venturing into frameworks (2019-Present)</h3>
			<p>
				Although I did experience having to use frameworks with TransitSafe and SoundFace, I've recently gone further with my use of more popular frameworks such as React (for frontend web applications), Spring (for Java/Kotlin-based backend services), and NodeJS (also for backend services).

						Window manager written in JavaScript. <a href="draggable/index.html">Here's a demo of it.</a> Notice that I've applied much of the styling from it (as of mid May 2020) on this website.

					<h3>Fourth Year Project <small>2019</small></h3>
					<p>
						My fourth/final(?) year (team) project at university was to build a system for institutions with campuses to better understand how people behave during evacuations. This involved building a backend service (Spring Framework for the application and PostgreSQL for databases), a website/web app for safety wardens (React), and a mobile app for anonymised data collection (React Native).
					</p>
					<p>
						Aside from getting the hang of React, this project was more of a learning experience for self-management (I really, really needed to learn how to control my scope for each user story, and didn't realise that it would affect the rest of my team) and managing expectations (with the client, our supervisors, and even other team members). Was it a success? Hardly, but it did set me on a path to better plan projects, at least.

			<h3>Foray into web development (2016-2019)</h3>
			<p>
				Most of the projects in this section were my first projects that were web apps, websites, and mobile apps. This period in my software engineering experience was ended with my internship at National Australia Bank where I got involved in backend development for the first time (most of my experience before then was more or less exclusively frontend-only).

					<h3>TransitSafe <small>2017-2019</small></h3>
					<p>
						Formerly known as Public Transport Reporter. It's an iOS app designed for both members of the public to report incidents and issues on the Melbourne public transportation network. Some incidents that could be reported included medical emergencies, crime, and hygiene.
					</p>
					<p>
						I designed and built this app for a university course on Android and iOS app development. We were required to write proposal reports (complete with prototype designs), and my report ended up being so long that the tutors were groaning amongst each other about how they had to review "these two horrifically long reports" (and so I learned that I wasn't the only one).

					<h3><a href='https://devpost.com/software/sound-face'>SoundFace</a> <small>2017</small></h3>
					<p>
						SoundFace was an app that used your facial expression to get a Spotify playlist that matches your mood. I built this with some classmates at university as part of a hackathon (UniHack 2017).
					</p>
					<p>
						It was built using the Ionic Framework (I was more involved in this; it allowed us to write a frontend in TypeScript and compile apps for both iOS and Android) and Node (for the backend service). We used Microsoft's Azure APIs for optical analysis (recognising emotions in faces) and Spotify's APIs (which provides some surprising data that could be used to determine the emotional profile of songs).
					</p>
					<p>
						We didn't win the hackathon with this idea. I came away from hackathon not just regretting that I pushed really hard for this idea to the team, but also learning that people truly did value software if it provided a clear benefit to society (which led me to the idea for the TransitSafe app).

					<h4><a href='https://antorca.github.io'>Antorca Linux</a> <small>2016-2019</small></h4>
					<p>
						Antorca was an attempt to inject life back into the illume OS project by starting from scratch. It was developed in a similar fashion to illume OS, as it was a remaster of more popular distributions. I experimented with maintaining both a Debian-based and Ubuntu-based version of Antorca simultaneously.
					</p>
					<p>
						The project sporadically started and stopped between 2016 and 2019 as I was in the midst of my Software Engineering degree at Monash University. I eventually ended it after coming to the conclusion that most people weren't really interested in keeping around old PCs to run some lightweight flavour of Linux any longer. I also realised that if Linux needed to be a serious contender for use on desktops and laptops, the community needed to rally around only a handful of general purpose distributions (like the official Ubuntu flavours, Fedora, openSUSE, Arch and its derivatives).
					</p>
					<p>
						I really love the Antorca brand (the logo definitely needs a change though), so I might be reviving it for future projects!

			<h3>Early projects (2008-2016)</h3>

					<h4><a href='https://illume-os.firebaseapp.com/'>illume OS</a> <small>2011-2016</small></h4>
					<p>
						illume OS was a lightweight Linux distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux. It offered IceWM as the default window manager (or light desktop environment?) and came bundled with lots of other lightweight 'alternative' applications (i.e. AbiWord and Gnumeric instead of LibreOffice). I used a then-popular package called Remastersys to image the virtual machine I used as a development environment as an ISO image for distribution (so yes, illume OS was largely a remaster of Debian). I wrote some scripts in Python and Bash to try and fill the gaps that most Linux distributions at the time had (e.g. an installer for lists or bundles of packages for different use cases like multimedia or productivity).
					</p>
					<p>
						I did my best to try and soup-up the design of the illume OS desktop by making my own IceWM theme, bundle some creative wallpapers (some were abstract pieces I made in GIMP, some were a selection of photos from photography trips my dad and I went on around Penang, and some were from classmates). Like the Forward project, I did make some ads or commercials for illume OS (but in iMovie, as I had moved over to the Mac by that time). Video editing software on Linux just wasn't up to scratch at that time (early 2010s).
					</p>
					<p>
						The project eventually died-down as I got through high school. A combination of me probably not being able to communicate what it was to classmates (and likewise their apathy or confusion), hitting a wall with numerous bugs that I just did not understand at the time, and a general lack of motivation due to the roughness of high school life.
					</p>
				</dd>
				<dd>
					<h4>Forward <small>2008-2011</small></h4>
					<p>
						My entry into the software development world began at the age of 10, with my first programming projects revolving around learning how to do batch scripting in Windows XP. This involved creating little shell programs that emulated a text user interface with pipe characters arranged (in fixed arrangements, thanks to monospaced fonts) to look like windows, buttons, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						I wrote many of these programs as 'products' of a 'company' called 'Forward Corporation'. I tried to get some of my school friends involved to hold certain positions at this 'company'. Obviously they were completely lost on what I was trying to accomplish.
					</p>
					<p>
						I used to make little ads or commercials for these apps in Windows Movie Maker and uploaded them on YouTube. I often used the music (which oddly enough didn't get copyright striked?) I had in my iTunes library at the time (I was just beginning to figure out what music I like at the time). Will I ever make these videos public (again)? I don't know, but time will tell.
